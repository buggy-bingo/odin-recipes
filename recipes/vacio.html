        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A grilled vacío is a flavorful cut of beef cooked slowly over hot embers on a simple metal grill. 
            The method creates a smoky, crispy crust while keeping the meat tender and juicy, highlighting its natural taste with minimal seasoning.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Vacío cut of beef (flank/skirt steak)</li>
            <li>Coarse salt (like sea salt or kosher salt)</li>
            <li>Optional: black pepper or chimichurri sauce for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the grill: Light the charcoal or wood and let it burn until you have hot embers.</li>
            <li>Season the meat: Sprinkle coarse salt evenly on both sides of the vacío.</li>
            <li>Place on grill: Lay the meat on the grill over indirect heat (not directly on flames) with the fat side up.</li>
            <li>Cook slowly: Grill for about 1 to 1.5 hours, turning occasionally, until the fat is crispy and the meat is tender.</li>
            <li>Rest and serve: Let the meat rest a few minutes, then slice against the grain and serve, optionally with chimichurri.</li>
        </ol>
